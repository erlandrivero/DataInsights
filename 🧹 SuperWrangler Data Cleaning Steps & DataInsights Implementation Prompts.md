# ðŸ§¹ SuperWrangler Data Cleaning Steps & DataInsights Implementation Prompts

This document provides a comprehensive review of all data cleaning steps implemented in SuperWrangler and detailed Windsurf prompts to implement the same robust cleaning capabilities in your DataInsights app.

---

## ðŸ“‹ SuperWrangler Data Cleaning Pipeline

Based on the review of your SuperWrangler app, here are ALL the cleaning steps performed:

### **Core Cleaning Steps (Always Applied)**

#### **Step 1: Column Normalization**
**Function:** `normalizeColumns()`

**What it does:**
- Converts all column names to lowercase
- Replaces special characters with underscores
- Removes leading/trailing underscores
- Handles empty or whitespace-only column names
- Creates `unnamed_column_N` for missing names
- Ensures consistent naming across datasets

**Example:**
- `"Fixed Acidity"` â†’ `"fixed_acidity"`
- `"pH Value"` â†’ `"ph_value"`
- `""` (empty) â†’ `"unnamed_column_1"`

---

#### **Step 2: Source Column Addition** (Dual Dataset Mode)
**Function:** `addSourceColumn()`

**What it does:**
- Adds `dataset_source` column to track data origin
- Labels rows as 'dataset1' or 'dataset2'
- Preserves data lineage for merged datasets
- Never overwrites existing columns

---

#### **Step 3: Common Column Identification** (Dual Dataset Mode)
**Function:** `findCommonColumns()`

**What it does:**
- Identifies columns present in both datasets
- Returns list of overlapping column names
- Used for intelligent merging

---

#### **Step 4: Dataset Alignment** (Dual Dataset Mode)
**Function:** `alignDatasets()`

**What it does:**
- Keeps only common columns from both datasets
- Ensures consistent structure for merging
- Drops dataset-specific columns

---

#### **Step 5: Numeric Conversion**
**Function:** `convertToNumeric()`

**What it does:**
- Attempts to parse all columns (except 'type') as numbers
- Converts valid numeric strings to float
- Sets invalid values to `null`
- Preserves categorical columns

**Example:**
- `"12.5"` â†’ `12.5`
- `"abc"` â†’ `null`
- `"3.14"` â†’ `3.14`

---

#### **Step 6: Duplicate Removal**
**Function:** `removeDuplicates()`

**What it does:**
- Identifies exact duplicate rows (all columns match)
- Uses JSON stringification for comparison
- Removes duplicates, keeping first occurrence
- Tracks and reports number of duplicates removed

**Your wine dataset example:** Removed 1,419 duplicates (21% of data)

---

#### **Step 7: Missing Value Imputation**
**Function:** `fillMissingValues()`

**What it does:**
- Calculates median for each numeric column
- Fills `null` values with column median
- Tracks count of filled values per column
- Reports total filled values

**Why median?** More robust to outliers than mean

---

### **Advanced Analysis Steps**

#### **Step 8: Column Analysis for Encoding**
**Function:** `analyzeColumnsForEncoding()` (from columnAnalysis.ts)

**What it does:**
- Analyzes every column's data type and cardinality
- Calculates unique value count
- Provides recommendations:
  - **Keep:** Low cardinality (< 50 unique values)
  - **Review:** Medium cardinality (50-100 unique values)
  - **Drop:** High cardinality (> 100 unique values, likely IDs)
- Suggests encoding strategies (One-Hot, Label, Target)

---

#### **Step 9: Balance Check**
**Function:** `checkBalance()` (from columnAnalysis.ts)

**What it does:**
- Auto-detects target column (lowest cardinality or common names)
- Calculates class distribution
- Computes imbalance ratio
- Provides status:
  - **Balanced:** Ratio < 1.5
  - **Slightly Imbalanced:** Ratio 1.5-3
  - **Imbalanced:** Ratio 3-5
  - **Severely Imbalanced:** Ratio > 5
- Recommends techniques (SMOTE, class weights, stratified sampling)

---

#### **Step 10: Feature Engineering** (Conditional)
**Function:** `engineerFeatures()`

**What it does:**
- **If wine columns detected:** Creates 6 wine-specific features
  - `so2_ratio` = free_sulfur_dioxide / total_sulfur_dioxide
  - `chlorides_to_sulphates` = chlorides / sulphates
  - `total_acidity_proxy` = fixed_acidity + volatile_acidity + citric_acid
  - `alcohol_x_sulphates` = alcohol Ã— sulphates
  - `density_centered` = density - mean(density)
  - `high_acidity_flag` = 1 if fixed_acidity > 75th percentile, else 0

- **If wine columns NOT found:** Gracefully skips with clear message

---

#### **Step 11: Smart Binning** (Conditional)
**Function:** `binColumns()`

**What it does:**
- **Quality binning** (if 'quality' column exists):
  - Low: â‰¤ 5
  - Medium: 5-6
  - High: > 6

- **Alcohol binning** (if 'alcohol' column exists):
  - Very Low: â‰¤ 10%
  - Low: 10-12%
  - Medium: 12-14%
  - High: > 14%

- **If columns not found:** Skips binning gracefully

**Goal:** Create a comprehensive data cleaning utility that implements all SuperWrangler cleaning steps.

**Windsurf Prompt:**

```
Upgrade the DataInsights app by creating a new utility file at `utils/data_cleaning.py`. This module will implement a comprehensive data cleaning pipeline similar to the SuperWrangler app.

Create a class called `DataCleaner` with the following methods:

1. `__init__(self, df)`: Initialize with a pandas DataFrame.

2. `normalize_column_names(self)`: 
   - Convert all column names to lowercase
   - Replace spaces and special characters with underscores
   - Remove leading/trailing underscores
   - Handle empty column names by creating 'unnamed_column_N'
   - Return the cleaned DataFrame

3. `convert_to_numeric(self, exclude_columns=[])`:
   - Attempt to convert all columns (except those in exclude_columns) to numeric
   - Use pd.to_numeric with errors='coerce'
   - Return the DataFrame with numeric conversions

4. `remove_duplicates(self)`:
   - Identify and remove exact duplicate rows
   - Return a tuple: (cleaned_df, duplicate_count)

5. `fill_missing_values(self, strategy='median')`:
   - For numeric columns: fill with median (or mean if strategy='mean')
   - For categorical columns: fill with mode
   - Track filled counts per column
   - Return a tuple: (filled_df, total_filled, filled_counts_dict)

6. `analyze_columns_for_encoding(self, threshold=50)`:
   - For each column, calculate unique value count
   - Provide recommendations: 'keep' (< threshold), 'review' (threshold to 2*threshold), 'drop' (> 2*threshold)
   - Return a DataFrame with columns: [column_name, dtype, unique_count, recommendation]

7. `check_balance(self, target_column=None)`:
   - If target_column is None, auto-detect (lowest cardinality or common names like 'target', 'label', 'class', 'quality')
   - Calculate class distribution and imbalance ratio
   - Determine status: 'Balanced', 'Slightly Imbalanced', 'Imbalanced', 'Severely Imbalanced'
   - Recommend techniques based on ratio
   - Return a dict with: target_column, distribution, imbalance_ratio, status, recommendations

8. `clean_pipeline(self, remove_dups=True, fill_missing=True, convert_numeric=True)`:
   - Execute the full cleaning pipeline in order
   - Return a dict with: cleaned_df, cleaning_report (with all stats)

Ensure all methods have proper docstrings and error handling. Use pandas best practices.
```

**Testing Checklist:**

1. Import the `DataCleaner` class from `utils/data_cleaning.py`.

2. Create a checkbox: "Apply Automatic Data Cleaning" (default: checked).

3. If the checkbox is checked, when data is loaded:
   - Instantiate `DataCleaner(df)`
   - Call `clean_pipeline()`
   - Display a cleaning summary in an expandable section showing:
     * Original rows vs. cleaned rows
     * Duplicates removed
     * Missing values filled (total and per column)
     * Column normalization applied
   - Update the dataframe in session state with the cleaned version

4. Add a "Column Analysis" expander that shows:
   - The output of `analyze_columns_for_encoding()`
   - A table with recommendations for each column

5. Add a "Balance Check" expander that shows:
   - The output of `check_balance()`
   - Class distribution chart
   - Imbalance status and recommendations

Ensure the cleaning happens before any analysis (MBA, Time Series, Anomaly, Text Mining) uses the data. Store both the original and cleaned dataframes in session state so users can toggle between them if needed.
```

### **PROMPT 4: Add Cleaning to Existing Analysis Modules** (30 min)

**Goal:** Ensure all existing analysis modules (MBA, Time Series, Anomaly, Text Mining) benefit from the cleaning pipeline.

**Windsurf Prompt:**

```
Upgrade all existing analysis modules in the DataInsights app to automatically use cleaned data.

For each module page (Market Basket Analysis, Time Series Forecasting, Anomaly Detection, Text Mining):

1. After data upload, add a small info box that says:
   "âœ“ Data cleaning applied: [X] duplicates removed, [Y] missing values filled"

2. Before running any analysis, check if cleaning has been applied. If not, apply it automatically using the `DataCleaner.clean_pipeline()` method.

3. Store cleaning stats in session state so they can be referenced in reports.

4. In the export/report generation for each module, include a "Data Quality" section that summarizes:
   - Original data shape
   - Cleaned data shape
   - Cleaning steps applied
   - Data quality score (calculate as: 100 - (missing_pct + duplicate_pct))

This ensures that all analyses are performed on clean, high-quality data.
```

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Verify cleaning info box appears on all analysis pages
- [ ] Test that cleaning is applied before analysis runs
