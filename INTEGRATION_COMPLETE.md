## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Pattern Used (Consistent Across All Integrations)

```python
from utils.process_manager import ProcessManager

pm = ProcessManager("Process_Name")

# Show warning
st.warning("⚠️ Do not navigate away - Navigation locked")

# Lock navigation
pm.lock()

try:
    # Progress tracking
    progress_bar = st.progress(0)
    status_text = st.empty()
    
    # Perform operation with progress updates
    status_text.text("Processing...")
    progress_bar.progress(0.5)
    
    # Complete operation
    # ... your code ...
    
    # Save checkpoint
    pm.save_checkpoint({'completed': True, ...})
    
    progress_bar.progress(1.0)
    status_text.text("✅ Complete!")
    
except Exception as e:
    st.error(f"❌ Error: {str(e)}")
    pm.save_checkpoint({'error': str(e)})
    
finally:
    # Always unlock
    pm.unlock()
    st.info("✅ Navigation unlocked")
```
