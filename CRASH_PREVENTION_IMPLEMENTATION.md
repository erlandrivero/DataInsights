- Integration: app.py line 5720
- Features:
  - One model at a time (prevents memory spikes)
  - gc.collect() after each model
  - Memory monitoring before/after
  - Only stores essential results (not full model objects)
  - Progress callback for real-time updates

**ML Regression:**
- Method: `train_models_sequentially()` (lines 316-383)
- Integration: app.py line 6762
- Features:
  - Same as ML Classification
  - Compatible with existing result format

   - Downcast floats to float32
   - Convert low-cardinality objects to category (if <50% unique)
   - Typically saves 30-50% memory

2. **Automatic Sampling:**
   - Triggers for datasets >100,000 rows
   - User-configurable sample size (10K-200K)
   - Preserves full dataset in `data_full`
   - Displays memory savings

3. **Memory Tracking:**
   - get_memory_usage() - Detailed DataFrame analysis
   - compare_memory_usage() - Before/after comparison
   - Per-column memory breakdown

**Integration** (app.py lines 320-365)
- Runs automatically on data upload
- Shows optimization results to user
- Sampling slider appears for large datasets
- Professional user feedback

## üìä Memory Management Features

### Automatic Cleanup Triggers
1. **Time-based:** Every 5 minutes
2. **Manual:** "Clean Up Memory" button (>80% usage)
3. **Between operations:** gc.collect() after each model
4. **On error:** Cleanup before error display

### Protected Session State Keys
These are NEVER automatically cleaned up:
- `data` - Current dataset
- `data_full` - Original full dataset (for large files)
- `profile` - Data profiling results

### Automatic Cleanup Candidates
These MAY be cleaned if >50MB:
- `*_results` - Analysis results
- `*_model` - Trained model objects
- `*_cached` - Cached computations
- `*_history` - Historical data

## üõ°Ô∏è Crash Prevention Mechanisms

### 1. Navigation Locking
**Problem:** User navigates during ML training ‚Üí Crash
**Solution:** NavigationGuard disables navigation during operations

**Implementation:**
```python
# In sidebar
guard = NavigationGuard()
is_processing = guard.is_any_process_running()

# Disable navigation
selection = st.radio(..., disabled=is_processing)
```

### 2. Memory Monitoring
**Problem:** Silent memory exhaustion ‚Üí Crash
**Solution:** Real-time monitoring with warnings

**Thresholds:**
- <70%: Green (normal)
- 70-80%: Yellow (monitor)
- >80%: Red (cleanup recommended)
- >90%: Auto-cleanup triggered

### 3. Sequential Execution
**Problem:** Parallel model training ‚Üí Memory spike ‚Üí Crash
**Solution:** Train one at a time with cleanup

**Pattern:**
```python
for model_name in models:
    train_model(model_name)
    del model
    gc.collect()
```

### 4. Data Sampling
**Problem:** 500K row dataset ‚Üí 2GB RAM ‚Üí Crash
**Solution:** Automatic sampling with user control

**Defaults:**
- <100K rows: No sampling
- 100K-200K: Recommend 50K sample
- >200K: Require sampling

## üéì Best Practices for Developers

### 1. Always Use ProcessManager for Long Operations
```python
from utils.process_manager import ProcessManager

pm = ProcessManager("Operation_Name")
pm.lock()

try:
    # Your long operation
    result = heavy_computation()
finally:
    pm.unlock()
```

### 2. Monitor Memory During Development
```python
memory_stats = ProcessManager.get_memory_stats()
print(f"Memory: {memory_stats['rss_mb']:.1f}MB ({memory_stats['percent']:.1f}%)")
```

### 3. Clean Up After Heavy Operations
```python
import gc

# After training/analysis
del large_object
gc.collect()
```

### 4. Sample Large Datasets
```python
from utils.data_optimizer import DataOptimizer

if DataOptimizer.should_sample_data(df):
    df = DataOptimizer.sample_data(df, sample_size=50000)
```

### 5. Optimize DataFrames on Load
```python
from utils.data_optimizer import DataOptimizer

df_optimized = DataOptimizer.optimize_dataframe(df)
memory_saved = original_mb - optimized_mb
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still Crashing
**Solutions:**
1. Reduce sample size (try 25K rows)
2. Train fewer models (3-4 max)
3. Increase cleanup frequency
4. Check Streamlit Cloud logs for specific errors

### Issue: Memory Monitor Not Showing
**Solutions:**
1. Verify psutil installed: `pip install psutil`
2. Add to requirements.txt
3. Restart Streamlit app

### Issue: Sequential Training Too Slow
**Solutions:**
1. This is expected (stability trade-off)
2. Reduce cross-validation folds (3 instead of 5)
3. Use smaller sample size
4. Train fewer models

### Issue: Cleanup Removes Needed Data
**Solutions:**
1. Add key to protected list in ProcessManager
2. Reduce cleanup threshold (currently 50MB)
3. Store essential data in `data` or `profile` keys
