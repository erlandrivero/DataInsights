## 🎓 Key Learnings & Insights

### SRM Detection
Sample Ratio Mismatch is a critical data quality check that prevents invalid A/B test results. Even slight imbalances (55/45) can indicate serious problems with randomization or data collection.

### Cold Start Problem
Production recommendation systems must handle new users gracefully. Popularity-based fallback ensures 100% user coverage while maintaining quality.

### Diversity vs Accuracy Trade-off
Perfect accuracy with low diversity = boring recommendations. Balance is key for user satisfaction and discovery.

### Influence Propagation Models
- **Independent Cascade:** Better for one-time sharing (viral posts)
- **Linear Threshold:** Better for adoption decisions (product purchases)

---

## 🚦 Next Steps (Optional)

### Testing & QA (3 hours)
- [ ] Test CSV exports for all 6 modules
- [ ] Verify SRM detection with imbalanced data
- [ ] Test cold start with edge cases
- [ ] Validate Cox model with multiple covariates
- [ ] Check diversity metrics calculations
- [ ] Simulate influence spread scenarios

### Documentation (4-6 hours)
- [ ] Update README with all new features
- [ ] Create user guide with screenshots
- [ ] Add API documentation
- [ ] Record demo videos
- [ ] Write blog post about improvements

### Future Enhancements (Low Priority)
- Sequential testing for A/B tests
- Market expansion analysis for geospatial
- Link prediction for network analysis
- Predictive churn modeling for cohorts
