# Data Loading Improvements - Time Series, Text Mining & Anomaly Detection

## Date: October 26, 2025

## Summary
Added comprehensive data loading sections to Time Series Forecasting, Text Mining, and Anomaly Detection modules, matching the pattern used in other analytics modules (Market Basket, RFM, etc.).

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Time Series Forecasting Module

**Added Section 1: Load Time Series Data**
- Three data source options:
  - ✅ **Use Loaded Dataset** - Uses data from Data Upload page
  - ✅ **Use Sample Data** - Classic airline passengers dataset (1949-1960)
  - ✅ **Upload Custom Data** - Direct file upload (CSV/Excel)

**Sample Dataset Details:**
- **Name:** International Airline Passengers
- **Period:** January 1949 to December 1960
- **Size:** 144 monthly observations
- **Features:** Date column + Passengers column
- **Characteristics:** Clear trend and seasonality patterns
- **Use Case:** Perfect for demonstrating time series forecasting

**Section Numbering Updated:**
- Section 1: Load Time Series Data (NEW)
- Section 2: Configure Time Series (was Section 1)
- Section 3: Time Series Analysis (was Section 2)
- Section 4: Generate Forecasts (was Section 3)
- Section 5: Model Comparison (was Section 4)

### 2. Text Mining Module

**Added Section 1: Load Text Data**
- Three data source options:
  - ✅ **Use Loaded Dataset** - Uses data from Data Upload page
  - ✅ **Use Sample Data** - Product reviews dataset
  - ✅ **Upload Custom Data** - Direct file upload (CSV/Excel)

**Sample Dataset Details:**
- **Name:** Sample Product Reviews
- **Size:** 50 reviews
- **Features:** Review column (text) + ReviewID column
- **Sentiment Distribution:** Mixed (positive, negative, neutral)
- **Content:** Realistic customer feedback patterns
- **Use Case:** Perfect for demonstrating sentiment analysis and topic modeling

**Section Numbering Updated:**
- Section 1: Load Text Data (NEW)
- Section 2: Select Text Column (was Section 1)
- Section 3: Text Analysis (was Section 2)

### 3. Anomaly Detection Module

**Added Section 1: Load Data**
- Three data source options:
  - ✅ **Use Loaded Dataset** - Uses data from Data Upload page
  - ✅ **Use Sample Data** - Credit card transaction dataset
  - ✅ **Upload Custom Data** - Direct file upload (CSV/Excel)

**Sample Dataset Details:**
- **Name:** Credit Card Transactions with Anomalies
- **Size:** 210 transactions (200 normal + 10 anomalies)
- **Features:** Amount, Frequency, TimeOfDay, ActualLabel
- **Anomaly Types:**
  - Extremely high/low transaction amounts
  - Unusual transaction frequencies
  - Odd time-of-day patterns
- **Use Case:** Perfect for testing anomaly detection algorithms
- **Note:** ActualLabel is included for reference but not used by unsupervised algorithms

**Section Numbering Updated:**
- Section 1: Load Data (NEW)
- Section 2: Dataset Overview (was Section 1)
- Section 3: Select Features for Analysis (was Section 2)
- Section 4: Configure Detection Algorithm (was Section 3)
- Section 5: Detection Results (was Section 4)

## Benefits

### User Experience Improvements:
1. **Consistency:** All three modules now match the data loading pattern of other modules
2. **Accessibility:** Users can experience modules without uploading their own data
3. **Learning:** Sample datasets are educational and demonstrate module capabilities
4. **Flexibility:** Three options provide maximum convenience

### Sample Data Advantages:
1. **Instant Testing:** No need to find/prepare datasets
2. **Known Patterns:** Sample data has predictable characteristics for learning
3. **Documentation:** Built-in descriptions explain dataset features
4. **Quality:** Curated data ensures good results for demonstrations

## Technical Implementation

### Time Series Sample Data:
```python
# Classic airline passengers dataset
dates = pd.date_range(start='1949-01', end='1960-12', freq='MS')
passengers = [112, 118, 132, ...] # 144 observations
df = pd.DataFrame({'Date': dates, 'Passengers': passengers})
```

### Text Mining Sample Data:
```python
# 50 realistic product reviews
sample_reviews = [
    "This product is absolutely amazing! ...",
    "Terrible quality, broke after ...",
    ...
]
df = pd.DataFrame({'Review': sample_reviews, 'ReviewID': range(1, 51)})
```

### Anomaly Detection Sample Data:
```python
# 210 credit card transactions (200 normal + 10 anomalies)
np.random.seed(42)
normal_amounts = np.random.normal(loc=100, scale=30, size=200)
anomaly_amounts = [very high amounts + very low amounts]
# Features: Amount, Frequency, TimeOfDay
# Hidden anomalies with unusual patterns
df = pd.DataFrame({'Amount': ..., 'Frequency': ..., 'TimeOfDay': ..., 'ActualLabel': ...})
```

## Files Modified
- `app.py` (show_time_series_forecasting function, ~lines 7067-7120)
- `app.py` (show_text_mining function, ~lines 7662-7787)
- `app.py` (show_anomaly_detection function, ~lines 6627-6747)

---

## Testing Status
✅ Syntax validation passed (`python -m py_compile app.py`)
⏳ Ready for user testing

---

## Next Steps
1. Test both modules with sample data
2. Verify section numbering is correct throughout
3. Test transitions between data source options
4. Commit changes to Git
5. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud
