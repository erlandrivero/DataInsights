## Charts Included in Exports

The advanced exports automatically detect and include charts from completed analyses:

| **ML Regression** | Model comparison (R¬≤, RMSE, MAE) |
| **Market Basket Analysis** | Association rules scatter plot (support vs confidence) |
| **RFM Analysis** | Customer segmentation distribution |
| **Anomaly Detection** | Anomaly vs normal distribution |

The number of available charts is displayed at the bottom of the export section.

## Installation Guide

### For HTML Export (No Installation Needed)
HTML exports work out-of-the-box! Just click and download.

### For Markdown + Images
```bash
pip install kaleido
```

### For PDF Export

**Windows:**
```bash
# Option 1: weasyprint (recommended)
pip install weasyprint

# Option 2: reportlab (simpler)
pip install reportlab
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
# weasyprint
pip install weasyprint

# reportlab
pip install reportlab
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Kaleido not installed" warning
**Solution:** Install kaleido to enable PNG image generation:
```bash
pip install kaleido
```
Without it, Markdown exports will still work but won't include chart images.

### "PDF generation requires additional libraries"
**Solution:** Install one of the PDF libraries:
```bash
pip install weasyprint  # recommended
# OR
pip install reportlab
```

### HTML export works but charts don't appear
**Possible causes:**
- No analyses have been run yet (no charts to export)
- Browser JavaScript is disabled
- Internet connection required for Plotly CDN (first time only)

**Solution:** 
- Run some analyses first to generate charts
- Enable JavaScript in browser
- For offline use, download the HTML file once while online

### Charts look different in PDF vs HTML
**Expected behavior:** 
- HTML charts are **interactive** (zoom, hover, pan)
- PDF charts are **static images** (print-friendly)
- This is by design for different use cases

## Best Practices

### For Presentations
‚úÖ Use **HTML with Charts** for interactive demos  
‚úÖ Use **PDF Report** for printed handouts

### For Documentation
‚úÖ Use **Markdown + Images** for GitHub/GitLab  
‚úÖ Commit both the `.md` file and `images/` folder

### For Archiving
‚úÖ Use **PDF Report** for long-term storage  
‚úÖ PDFs are more stable and readable across systems

### For Sharing
‚úÖ Use **HTML with Charts** for technical audiences  
‚úÖ Use **PDF Report** for executive summaries

---

## Technical Details
